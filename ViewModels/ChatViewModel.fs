/// The chat inside the community section (PULSE in the code, CHAT on screen).
///
/// Three rules keep it cheap, and none of them costs the user anything:
///
///   1. **Only new messages are ever fetched.** A poll asks for ids greater
///      than the newest one on screen, plus the reaction changes since the
///      last poll. History is never downloaded twice.
///   2. **The last messages are kept on disk.** Opening the chat after a
///      restart paints them immediately and asks only for what arrived since.
///   3. **Polling follows attention.** Every few seconds while the chat is on
///      screen and the window is in front; slower when nothing is happening;
///      a slow check for replies otherwise; nothing while the window is not
///      the one in front.
